1. {*, -, /, +} are operators {"hello", -8.8, 5} are values

2. spam - variable 
   'spam' - string

3. string, int, floating point

4. An expression is the most basic kind of programming instruction in the language. Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate and get reduced down to a single value. That means you can use expressions anywhere in Python code that you could also use a value.

5. Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable where as an Expression is an instruction consisting of values and operators which is reduced to a single value.

6. Remains unchanged

7. spamspamspam and spamspamspam

8. We can't use numbers as variables or even start a variable name with a number, if we wanna do that then we have to put an underscore before the number to use it as variable.

9. We can typecast the value or a datatype to another by using the int(), float() and str() functions.

10. We can't concatenate int with string. For using this expression, you have to typecaste the int 99 to string by replacing it with str(99).
    the correct syntax must be- 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
    this will evaluate str(99) into '99' and concatenation will be done
